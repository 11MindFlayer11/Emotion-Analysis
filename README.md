# Emotion-Analysis

Overview

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect human emotions from facial expressions. The model is trained on a Kaggle dataset and uses deep learning techniques to classify images into different emotion categories.

Features

CNN Architecture: Custom-built deep learning model for emotion classification.

Data Preprocessing: Image normalization and resizing.

Data Augmentation: Techniques like flipping, rotation, and zooming to improve generalization.

Model Training: Utilized deep learning frameworks to optimize accuracy.

Performance Evaluation: Metrics such as accuracy and loss visualization.

Technologies Used

Python

TensorFlow/Keras

NumPy & Pandas

OpenCV

Matplotlib & Seaborn
